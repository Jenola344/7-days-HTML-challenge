                        <h2>Our Heritage</h2>
                        <p>Jenola's Intercontinental Restaurant was born from a passion for bringing the world's finest culinary traditions to Ibadan. Founded by Chef Jenola Adebayo in 2015, our restaurant represents a decade of dedication to authentic international cuisine and exceptional hospitality.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Chef Jenola's journey began with extensive travels across four continents, where she studied traditional cooking methods, sourced authentic ingredients, and learned from master chefs in their native kitchens. This global culinary education formed the foundation of our restaurant's philosophy: to honor the authenticity of each dish while creating an accessible and welcoming dining experience for our local community.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Today, Jenola's stands as Ibadan's premier destination for intercontinental dining, serving over 200 satisfied customers daily and maintaining our reputation for excellence through consistent quality and innovation.</p>
